# 🛠️ Object Defect Detection using CNN  
**Capstone Project – Studi Independen Bersertifikat (MSIB) Batch 5**

This project was developed as a **Capstone Project** for the Studi Independen Bersertifikat (MSIB) program in 2023. The focus of this project is to build an automated defect detection system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.

## 📌 Project Overview

In manufacturing processes, quality inspection is often performed manually and is prone to human error.  

This project aims to develop an image classification model capable of distinguishing:

- **Defective products**
- **Non-Defective products**

The system is built as an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to automated prediction output.

## 🧠 Approach

### 1. Data Preparation
- Organizing labeled image datasets  
- Image resizing and normalization  
- Splitting data into training and testing sets  

### 2. Model Development
- Designing and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  
- Training the model using TensorFlow/Keras  
- Saving the trained model in `.hdf5` format  

### 3. Evaluation & Prediction
- Evaluating model performance  
- Running inference on test images  
- Exporting prediction results into CSV/Excel format
